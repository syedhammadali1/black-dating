                                You can pay the fees for your subscription on the Platform or the App (when available)
                                through the options described at the payment page or app store.

                                The price of your subscription, as well as the currency in which your subscription is
                                payable, will be specified during the order process, and may vary depending on your
                                country of residence (as determined by the IP address of your device used to access the
                                Platform).

                                When you purchase a subscription, you must provide us with complete and accurate payment
                                information. By submitting payment details, you represent that you are entitled to
                                purchase a subscription using those payment details. If we do not receive payment
                                authorization or any authorization is subsequently cancelled, we may immediately
                                terminate or suspend your access to your subscription. The Platform reserves the right
                                to contact the issuing bank/payment provider and/or law enforcement authorities or other
                                appropriate third parties if there is suspicious activity.

                                In addition to the subscription fee you are charged, certain banks and credit card
                                issuers may charge a foreign transaction fee on transactions which take place abroad or
                                in a foreign currency. You are responsible for paying any such fees.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The subscription services are not transferable, whether for free or as a sale or barter
                                transaction, and the Platform does not recognize any purported transfers of subscription
                                services. Accordingly, you may not trade, sell, gift or attempt to sell any subscription
                                services for value of any kind. Any such transfer or attempted transfer is prohibited
                                and void, and will subject your account to termination.
                            </p>

                            <p>

                                reduction for, any withholding taxes. Any such taxes imposed on payments of fees to the
                                Platform will be your sole responsibility, and you will provide the Platform with
                                official receipts issued by the appropriate taxing authority, or such other evidence as
                                we may reasonably request, to establish that such taxes have been paid.

                                When the option is available and chosen on the Platform, your subscription will
                                automatically renew unless you cancel at least twenty-four (24) hours before the end of
                                the current billing period. You will also be informed about the automatic renewal prior
                                to the end of the current billing period with an email. Upon such cancellation, you will
                                still be entitled to access the subscription services on the Platform for the remainder
                                of the duration that you have paid for.

                            <p>
                                As you are allowed to cancel the automatic renewal at any time before the end of the
                                current billing period, you are not entitled to receive a refund for the subscription
                                and your access will continue until the expiration of the billing period.
                            </p>

                                If you have subscribed for the Platform through an app store, the cancellation and
                                refund of subscription fees will be governed by the applicable terms and conditions of
                                that app store. The Platform itself does not provide any refund apart from the app
                                stores.
                            </p>

                                Nevertheless, in this case we reserve the right to terminate your account, or prevent

                                Where you have chosen non-recurring subscription through our Platform, you may change
                                your mind and cancel your subscription at any time. In this case you will receive a

                                have used the subscription services.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Take into consideration that in order to mitigate abusive refund requests, you agree on
                                our early termination penalty which applies in the first 10 days starting from the date
                                of the subscription/renewal. This means that if you cancel your subscription in the
                                first 10 days (for example day 1 or day 5 or day 9), we will charge 10 days subscription
                                services (or the amount of 10 USD, whichever is higher) and will refund you the amount
                                equal to the rest of the days until the end of the subscription/renewal period.

                                After a payment is made and following expiry of the subscription period, fees paid of
                                subscriptions are non-refundable and there is no right to refunds or credits unless

                                If you are a Registered User on the Platform, you can terminate your User Account at any
                                time.

                                The termination possibilities are two:

                                    Deactivation – in this case we just temporarily switch off your account. We save
                                    your profile information in case you later decide to restore your account. You will
                                    therefore be able to restore your account and your profile in its entirety within 36
                                    months of deactivating it.

                                    Deletion – in this case we permanently erase your account and all Content and
                                    settings. With request of deletion, we have the right to delete any related Content
                                    that you have submitted or uploaded on to the Platform.

                                the extent that this is feasible, one term/sub-term or part thereof may be taken into
                                consideration separately, in order for the remaining part to become valid. The term will
                                be construed accordingly.

                                We also may introduce amendments to the Terms. The amended Terms are published on the

                                additionally, within 7 days as of publication send notification thereof to the
                                Registered Users at the email specified by the User.

                                should leave the Platform and abstain from using the Platform.

                                amendments, they should inform us within 3 days from the amendment. In case within one
                                month the Registered User does not object to the amendments, it is deemed that the
                                Registered User accepts the amendments and is bound by the Terms as amended. In case the
                                Registered User objects to the amendments, the contract between Us and the User is
                                terminated upon receipt of the User’s notification.
